# Regularization Update: Zero Start + Bounded Learning

## **[Zenith]** Minimal Changes for Stable Learning! ðŸŽ¯

Updated the system to start from zero and prevent extreme values through regularization.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made**

### **1. Zero Initialization**
```python
# Before: Start with neutral bias
weekly_habit_scores = [0.5] * 168

# After: Start from pure zero (no bias)
weekly_habit_scores = [0.0] * 168
```

### **2. Habit Score Regularization**
```python
def update_habit_score():
    # ... existing learning logic ...
    
    # NEW: Regularization to prevent extreme values
    regularization_strength = 0.05
    if new_score > 0.8:
        new_score = new_score * 0.95 + 0.5 * 0.05  # Pull back toward 0.5
    elif new_score < 0.2:
        new_score = new_score * 0.95 + 0.5 * 0.05  # Pull up toward 0.5
```

### **3. Slot Confidence Regularization**
```python
# NEW: Both success and failure update confidence
if success:
    new_confidence = current_confidence + 0.1  # Increase
else:
    new_confidence = current_confidence - 0.05  # Decrease

# NEW: Regularization for slot confidence too
if new_confidence > 0.8:
    new_confidence = new_confidence * 0.95 + 0.5 * 0.05
elif new_confidence < 0.2:
    new_confidence = new_confidence * 0.95 + 0.5 * 0.05
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

### **âœ… Unbiased Learning**
- Start from zero â†’ no initial assumptions
- System learns purely from user behavior
- More accurate pattern detection

### **âœ… Stable Values**
- Regularization prevents 0.0 or 1.0 extremes
- Values naturally drift toward 0.5 when unused
- Prevents overfitting to small sample sizes

### **âœ… Balanced Updates**
- Failures now decrease slot confidence (more realistic)
- Extreme values get pulled back toward center
- System remains adaptable to changing patterns

## ðŸ“Š **Example Learning Progression**

```python
# New task type starts at zero
habit_score = 0.0

# First success: 0.0 â†’ 0.27 (big jump for new data)
# Second success: 0.27 â†’ 0.46 (smaller jump, more data)
# Third success: 0.46 â†’ 0.58 (even smaller jump)
# ...
# Many successes: approaches ~0.85 but regularization prevents going to 1.0

# If user stops using this time slot:
# Regularization slowly pulls it back toward 0.5
```

## ðŸ”„ **Files Updated**

1. **`models.py`** - Changed default initialization to 0.0
2. **`supabase_schema.sql`** - Updated database function to use 0.0
3. **`learning_service.py`** - Added habit score regularization
4. **`task_type_service.py`** - Added slot confidence regularization

**Total: 4 minimal changes for more stable, unbiased learning!** âœ…
